# Music Source Separation

Similar to music transcription, music source separation task in a real-world situation also involves a larger and growing scope of instrument classes
compared to the research-level benchmark dataset. Therefore, the ability to adapt novel instrument classes using the FSL or ZSL paradigm can contribute to the generalization of source separation models. We will go over how each of the few-shot conditioning and the zero-shot query-based approaches have tackled this problem effectively.
