# Classification

Several studies have applied FSL to recognize novel sound events based on a few labeled examples. Methods and findings in these studies should be transferable to classification tasks in the MIR field as most datasets that were used contain musical sounds. More recently, FSL is applied to musical instrument classification leveraging the hierarchical relationship between instrument classes.
