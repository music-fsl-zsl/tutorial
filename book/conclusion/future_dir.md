# Future Directions

In this section, we would like to highlight some remaining challenges and potential future directions for FSL and ZSL in MIR. 

1. **Train FSL/ZSL models with less labeled data** - Unsupervised FSL {cite}`khodadadeh2019`, semi-supervised FSL {cite}`ren18fewshotssl`
2. **Leverage existing pre-trained models** - Few-shot continual learning {cite}`wang2021-continual`{cite}`wang2021-rethink-fsl`
3. **New FSL/ZSL methods**
4. **User study** - Support set selection process, interaction flow
5. **Apply FSL/ZSL to more MIR tasks** - Recommendation, generation, problems that you are working on?
