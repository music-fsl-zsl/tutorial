After going through this tutorial, we hope that you now have an idea about 

1. What is FSL and ZSL and their strengths.

2. How to build the training and evaluation pipeline for the few-shot and zero-shot classificaiotn models. 

3. What have been done and what to be done in MIR with FSL/ZSL

Thank you so much for reading! We hope we provide a different perspective to think about the MIR tasks that you are working on. :)
