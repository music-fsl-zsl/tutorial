# Summary

After this tutorial, we hope that you now have a better idea about 

1. The foundations and strengths of FSL/ZSL.

2. How to build the training and evaluation pipeline for the few-shot and zero-shot classification models. 

3. What has been done and what can be done in the future in MIR with FSL/ZSL.

Thank you so much for reading! We hope that we provide a different perspective to think about the MIR tasks that you are working on! :)
